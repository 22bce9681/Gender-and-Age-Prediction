# 🧠 Gender and Age Prediction using Deep Learning

## 📅 Duration
**Mar 2025 – July 2025**

---

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on building a **deep learning-based system** that predicts **gender and age** from facial images with high accuracy.  
It utilizes a **CNN architecture with transfer learning**, optimized for real-time inference.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Achieved **92% accuracy** with ±4 years error in age estimation.  
- Used **Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and CNN models** for training and evaluation.  
- Optimized model for **1-second inference time** per image.  
- Trained on a large dataset with **10,000+ labeled facial images**.  
- Deployed model and source code available on GitHub for open research contribution.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Dataset includes male and female faces of multiple age groups.  
- Preprocessed using OpenCV: face detection, alignment, and resizing.  
- Applied augmentation: rotation, flipping, and scaling.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Tools:** Google Colab, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook
